                     my work would not be taking me in any new, creative design directions. Thankfully, I found Salman
                     Khan and his creativity that goes above and beyond, proving to be exactly what I needed to take.

                     with. He is seriously what you would call 'creative': he innovatively solves all sorts of problems
                     and always delivers both prompt and high quality work. I can't recommend him enough!
